Frag Recruit is a project we created made with React, Node.js, and Firebase.

Frag Recruit aims to be a new platform for gamers to get recruited in to the Esports world. While trying to think of an idea for a project, our Team struggled to find anything that helped gamers get their names out to Esports organizations. To try and solve this problem, we have built Frag Recruit to allow gamers to upload their clips, share their experience in the game, make connections, and get recruited.
